# Predictive Maintenance Project

This project focuses on building a machine learning solution for **Predictive Maintenance** â€“ the process of predicting equipment failures before they occur. By leveraging sensor data and advanced analytics, the model identifies patterns that indicate early signs of malfunction or degradation.  

The goal is to:
- Reduce unexpected downtime  
- Minimize maintenance costs  
- Increase equipment lifespan  
- Improve operational efficiency  

The project applies data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to forecast failures in industrial systems, providing actionable insights for proactive maintenance strategies.
